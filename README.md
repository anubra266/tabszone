## üéØ Why TabsZone?

Traditional bookmarks are static and don't preserve your browsing context. TabsZone saves the **entire state** of your browser windows - all tabs, their positions, and visual previews. It's like having multiple desktops for your web browsing.

Perfect for:

- **Developers** managing different projects
- **Researchers** organizing complex information gathering
- **Students** keeping course materials separated
- **Anyone** who uses multiple tabs and wants better organization
